    <h3>Designing for the User</h3>
<p>The first part of this project was to create a rough draft of the package, and a set of both unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<p>For the first several weeks, I only used the package locally from the project folder, which turned out to be much easier than writing a working, pip-installable package.</p>
<p>So that was the next goal to accomplish&mdash;but I also wanted to ensure to follow best practices and maintain stability.</p>
<p>These tasks presented many issues I had not yet considered, and many of them I did not (yet) know how to answer. </p>
<p>Writing a package that will be used by other people poses an important question.</p>
<h5>"How will other people use this module, and how do I make it most useful to them?"</h5>
<hr>
<!--more--></p>
<p>This week, I will be adding my tests to a <a href="https://jenkins.io/" target="_blank">Jenkins</a> pipeline, so that we can see them in action.</p>
<p>I expect that this will help me answer some of the questions I've been struggling with.</p>
<p>Without this feedback, most of the decision-making about design and implementation is just guesswork. </p>
<h3>Best Practices and Stability</h3>
<p>I knew that I would be deploying this package to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi" target="_blank">PyPi</a>, so I designed it according to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#configuring-your-project" target="_blank">structure of a pip package</a> from the beginning.</p>
<p>This simplified the first stage of the process, as the most basic requirements were already fulfilled.</p>
<p>However, I have done quite a lot of rearranging and re-rearranging in the process of deciding what this package should look like.</p>
<p>There were also some changes that needed to be made so that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/axe-selenium-python/" target="_blank">axe-selenium-python</a> would run within another project.</p>
<p>(These mostly concerned correctly referencing files, fixtures, and tests within the package.)</p>
<p>I did get some excellent code review from <a href="https://ziade.org/" target="_blank">Tarek Ziade</a>, a member of the Firefox Test Engineering Team.</p>
<p>Tarek has written <a href="https://ziade.org/books.html" target="_blank">multiple books on python</a>, so I was a little intimidated when he offered to review my code.</p>
<p>However, I strive to produce the best code possible, so I always welcome constructive criticism.</p>
<p>He pointed out several things I had <a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/axe-selenium-python/pull/24/files" target="_blank">either missed or hadn't considered</a>.</p>
<p>I credit his feedback for helping me take this package from a rough draft state to an early-stage MVP.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the changes that I needed to make to improve the stability of the project was to remove the absolute path to the JavaScript file, and to make the file path OS-independent:</p>
<p>[python]<br />
_DEFAULT_SCRIPT = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'src', 'axe.min.js')<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>This script grabs the JavaScript file in relation to the <em>module currently being executed</em>.</p>
<p>I did find that something interesting happens with this line of code, however.</p>
<p>If I run tests from within the project folder, it will look for the <code>src</code> directory within the <code>tests</code> directory.</p>
<p>If I run tests <strong>externally</strong>, within another project, it will look for the <code>src</code> directory within the top-level directory of the package, <code>axe_selenium_python</code>.</p>
<p>This code also uses <code>os.path.join</code> to create the OS-independent file path.</p>
<p>For example, if this package is run on Windows, the file path will use back slashes: <code>axe_selenium_python\src\axe.min.js</code>.</p>
<p>And forward slashes will be used for Unix-based operating systems.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Deploying to PyPi</h3>
<p>I had some difficulty figuring how to upload to the <a href="http://testpypi.python.org" target="_blank">Test PyPi site</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that they are in the process of migrating from <a href="http://pypi.python.org" target="_blank">pypi.python.org</a> to <a href="http://pypi.org" target="_blank">pypi.org</a>, which has created <a href="https://gist.github.com/boppreh/ac7522b3a4ac46b4f6010eecddc57f21" target="_blank">much frustration for other developers</a> as well.</p>
<p>Much of the documentation I found was outdated, and I was receiving "server gone" errors when trying to upload to the test site:</p>
<pre>
Server response (410): Gone (This API has been deprecated and removed from legacy PyPI in favor of using the APIs available in the new PyPI.org implementation of PyPI (located at https://pypi.org/). For more information about migrating your use of this API to PyPI.org, please see https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-org/#uploading. For more information about the sunsetting of this API, please see https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-June/030766.html)
</pre>
<p>&#x1F631;</p>
<p>I did finally get it working, however.</p>
<p><img src="images/rejoice.jpg" alt="and there was much rejoicing - monty python" width="625" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-617" /></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI" target="_blank">Here's the wiki page</a> that finally got me past this point, if you find yourself in the same position.</p>

<h3>Run It!</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6QGe-pXgdI?start=70&amp;feature=oembed" allowfullscreen="" height="148.09" frameborder="0" width="263.55"></iframe></p>
<p>As expected, installing the package from pip presented new problems that didn't exist when running it locally, like the previous issue with the JavaScript file.</p>
<p>Another problem I encountered involved the use of pytest fixtures.</p>
<p>I have gone back and forth on whether to use the fixtures at all. As of now, there are some instances where I do, and some where I don't. </p>
<p>The users are free to use either method.</p>
<h4>Pytest Fixtures</h4>
<h5>What is a fixture?</h5>
<p>If you're interested, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html" target="_blank">here is the technical description</a> of a pytest fixture.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the fixtures make some tasks easier and less wordy in their implementation.</p>
<p>Members of the Test Engineering team have written and use many different fixtures, and for different purposes.</p>
<p>A simple example is the <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-base-url" target="_blank">base_url fixture</a>. This fixture pulls the <code>base_url</code> setting from a config file, such as <code>tox.ini</code>, and uses it for selenium-based tests.</p>
<p>This removes the need to either specify the URL every time the tests are run, or to hard-code it within your tests (which is generally recommended against).</p>
<p>A more complex example is the <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium" target="_blank">selenium fixture</a>. </p>
<p>Instantiating a WebDriver instance requires a few lines of code:</p>
<p>[python]<br />
from selenium import webdriver</p>
<p>driver = webdriver.Firefox()<br />
driver.get("http://www.python.org")<br />
driver.close()<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>This same task can be implemented simply by passing the <code>selenium</code> fixture as a parameter in your test function:</p>
<p>[python]<br />
import pytest_selenium</p>
<p>test_python_home_page(self, selenium):<br />
  assert "Python" in selenium.title<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>(This example assumes that <code>base_url</code> is set to <code>http://www.python.org</code> in your config file.)</p>
<p>This implementation also does not require closing the WebDriver instance at the conclusion of the test; <code>pytest-selenium</code> will do this for you when the test ends.</p>
<h5>pytest-axe</h5>
<p>The fixture that I wrote simply creates an instance of the Axe class, using a <code>selenium</code> instance.</p>
<p>When running tests locally, I had my fixture within the <code>conftest.py</code> file.</p>
<p>If users do want to use the axe fixture, I didn't want them to have to manually modify their <code>conftest.py</code>.</p>
<p>So, I wrote a very simple plugin, <a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/pytest-axe" target="_blank">pytest-axe</a>, to enable the use of this fixture.</p>
<p>Sometimes the fixtures makes testing a little more simple, but there are some tasks that can't be accomplished when using fixtures.</p>
<hr>
<h5>pytest-selenium</h5>
<p>Another thing I have been struggling with is whether or not I should be using pytest-selenium at all.</p>
<p>I went back and forth with this a bit in the beginning. For the sake of time, I decided to proceed with pytest-selenium.</p>
<p>It really isn't possible to know what users will want at this point, so instead of trying to produce something perfect from the beginning, my focus is to produce something <em>usable</em>.</p>
<h5>Jenkins Testing</h5>
<p>As I said, this week I have been focused on running my tests in a Jenkins environment.</p>
<p>This should help me to make more informed decisions on my implementation.</p>
<p>Currently, the test suite I have been working with is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozillians-tests" target="_blank">mozillians-tests</a>.</p>
<p>This is a series of tests for the <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/" target="_blank">public Mozilla phonebook</a>, a directory of Mozilla employees and contributors.</p>
<p>I am experimenting with using an all-in-one test & report vs. a set of individual rule tests.</p>
<p>While a single test would still provide helpful feedback, there are a couple of issues with this approach.</p>
<p>If a single accessibility rule is violated, the test is marked as a failure.</p>
<p>There is also no way to <code>xfail</code> individual rules.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>xfail</code> is a decorator to indicate an expected failure. This allows test suites to return an OK until the problem is fixed. Once the test starts passing again, a flag is raised to the test team, signalling that the test was expected to fail, but is now passing.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it definitely seems like individual rule tests are the way to go. This is a bit more difficult to implement.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/axe-selenium-python/blob/master/axe_selenium_python/test_accessibility_rules.py" target="_blank">Here are my tests</a> for the accessibility rules.</p>
<p>I have been playing with different approaches to accomplish this goal. </p>
<p>Considering there are only a couple of weeks left of this internship, solving this problem is the highest priority at the moment.</p>
<p>None of these approaches are particularly pretty at the moment, but I'm confident that I'll have a more usable and stable implementation by the end of this week.</p>
