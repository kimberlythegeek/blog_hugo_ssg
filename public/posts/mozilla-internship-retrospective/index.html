    <h2>A Conclusion to My Internship</h2>
<p>When I began this internship three months ago, neither myself nor my mentor had a clear picture of what I would produce, or how the goals of the project would change as time progressed.</p>
<p>The high-level goal of the internship was clear: to automate web accessibility testing. How best to do this, however, was not.</p>
<p>The first few weeks, as well as the weeks prior, were mostly spent on research.</p>
<p>I first needed to understand the problem domain, and then understand the tools available, as well as how to use them.</p>
<p>I had done some python programming before, but my work on this project was a side of python I had not delved into.</p>
<p>I had never used pytest or selenium, and knew nothing about python packaging (or accessibility, for that matter).</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the internship, I took a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891" target="_blank">Udacity course on web accessibility</a>, and wrote some simple tests using selenium and python.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>axe-selenium-python</h2>
<p>Most of my work on this project was spent writing the <a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/axe-selenium-python" target="_blank">axe-selenium-python</a> package, and figuring out how best to integrate accessibility tests into existing test suites.</p>
<p>Writing a python package was actually the stretch goal of my internship.</p>
<p>Completing an alpha-stage version took a lot less time than I anticipated.</p>
<p>Once I completed that, however, the number of questions and problems to solve quickly ballooned into a project that could span at least a year.</p>
<p>Given that I didn't have a year (and actually, by that point, had six weeks left), I focused on only two or three goals.</p>
<p>I wanted to produce something that other people could use, and would want to use, and chose the tasks that would best facilitate that.</p>
<p>This came down to three primary goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable users to easily include and customize accessibility rule tests.</li>
<li>Implement reporting that gives usable feedback on accessibility violations.</li>
<li>Provide sufficient documentation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Final Stretch</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the above tasks as well as I would have liked.</p>
<h4>Integrate Accessibility Tests</h4>
<p>I wanted to allow users to easily customize and generate individual tests for each accessibility rule, and to allow marking individual tests as <strong>expected failures</strong>.</p>
<p>This has multiple benefits. Individual tests would allow a user to quickly see what accessibility rules are failing, and provide a concise report on that rule.</p>
<p>Without individual tests, there would a single test that would fail if any accessibility violations were found, and the details would be provided as a single report.</p>
<p>I did, however, enable users to customize the accessibility test by setting the context and options, an included feature of the axe-core API, but also to filter for impact level.</p>
<p>This means that users can check only for critical violations, or for violations severe and higher, and so forth, for each impact level that axe-core uses to classify violations.</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>While there are many improvements I would <em>like</em> to make to the reporting, I did produce a usable report feature.</p>
<p>It closely resembles the report feature in axe-selenium-java.</p>
<p>I have gold-plating goals for this feature as well. I would like to create a pytest plugin, similar to pytest-html, that creates a single HTML accessibility report for each test suite or job.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>I did want to ensure that I didn't complete this project without documentation, or without <em>helpful</em> documentation.</p>
<p>I know from experience that it's very frustrating to find software that you want to use, but its documentation doesn't provide enough information on how to use it.</p>
<p>There is a great deal that could be added, but I believe it is sufficient to get someone started using the package.</p>
<h2>Goals for the Future</h3>
<p>As I said before, the list of "nice-to-have" features grew very long very quickly over the past several weeks.</p>
<p>This project could easily continue for another year fulfilling all of these goals.</p>
<p>Here's a basic list of what I envision for the future of this project, listed more or less from highest priority to lowest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement Individual Rule Tests</li>
<li>Enable Expected Failures (pytest xfail)</li>
<li>Write an Accessibility Report Plugin for Pytest</li>
<li>Add an Accessibility Stage to the Jenkins Testing Pipeline</li>
<li>Enable the Auto-Filing of Bugs When Tests Fail</li>
<li>Create a Dashboard of Mozilla's Web Assets with their Accessibility Rating</li>
<li>Increase Community Involvement in Accessibility Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been told that a lot of people are very excited about the work that I've been doing on this project.</p>
<p>It actually fills a need that several Mozilla employees have been wanting to accomplish for some time now. </p>
<p>It means a great deal to me to be doing meaningful work that makes a positive impact on people.</p>
<h2>Final Presentation</h2>
<p>To conclude my internship, I have decided to do I final presentation on this project.</p>
<p>This will be a high-level overview, and less technical than most of the blog posts I have written.</p>
<p>I will be presenting live to Mozillians over Vidyo, but the presentation will also be recorded, and available to the public on AirMozilla.</p>
<p>Currently, the presentation is scheduled for September 11 at 2:00 PM MST.</p>
<p>Employees of Mozilla will be able to view the presentation live in Matt Brandt's Vidyo Room.</p>
<p>The presentation will be recorded and will be available to the public on <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">AirMozilla</a>.</p>
<p>More details will be provided as they are available.</p>
