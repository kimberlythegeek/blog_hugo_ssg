                <p>A free and open internet.</p>

<p>"The internet is an integral part of modern life, a global public resource, which must enrich the lives of individual human beings."<sup><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/#principle-01">[1]</a> </sup></p>

<hr/>

<p>The internet is a vast resource of information, the likes of which have never existed before.</p>

<p>The technologies we possess today have become an indispensable resource, and they improve the quality of our lives in many ways.</p>

<p>But for some, technology is the only thing that stands between them and of a life of dependence and isolation.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Think perhaps...of a woman.</p>

<p>An intellectual, an academic.</p>

<p>At the height of her career, she gradually begins losing her ability to walk. To move. To speak.</p>

<p>And it progresses until the only physical ability that remains is flexing a small muscle in her face.</p>

<p>Without technology, we wouldn’t even know that woman was still there.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t know if she had the ability to form even the most basic of thoughts, let alone understand complex ideas.</p>

<p>However, with assistive technologies, we not only know that this woman is not brain dead, but she is given the ability to keep living.</p>

<p>She is able to continue her research, to publish her works in academic journals. She can connect with her loved ones on a daily basis.</p>

<p>She can laugh when her mouth will no longer move.</p>

<p>She can cry when she is unable to form tears.</p>

<p>She can give a warm embrace when the muscles in her arms have failed her.</p>

<p>She has a voice.</p>

<p>She has autonomy.</p>

<p>She has a life.</p>

<p>
I had originally planned to give a very technical (and probably a little boring) talk, on my work in automating web accessibility testing.</p>

<p>But I realized that my real work lies not in explaining to a group of engineers how to integrate an api into continuous integration environments.</p>

<p>My work is to help others understand why it matters.</p>

<p>The problem is not that people just don’t care about individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p>The problem is that we do not hear their voices.</p>

<p>We don’t know these problems exist until they tell us

<p>We cannot see the world through their eyes if we never connect with them.</p>

<p>This disconnect that exists results in products where some of our users are invisible.</p>

<p>It is impossible for an organization to create products and services for everyone if we only listen to the voices of a few.</p>

<p>We all have different experiences, and different perspectives on the world.</p>

<p>As such, we have unique insights to offer that others may not.</p>

<p>But more than that, our experiences matter.</p>

<p>We all have a voice. We all deserve to be heard.</p>

<p>People with disabilities are speaking out, and we need to listen.</p>
