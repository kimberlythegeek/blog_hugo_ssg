                <h2>The Basics of Child Themes</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why you should create child themes when using any customization. If you modify the CSS or PHP directly in a Wordpress theme, and later update the theme, all of your changes will be lost.</p>
<p>With child themes, you can update the parent themes without overwriting your custom styles.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>I prefer to use a theme released directly from Wordpress.org, such as Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, etc., because they are the most stable and maintained.</p>
<p>Sometimes, none of these are close enough to the design I'm going for, and I'd spend far too much time rewriting and modifying it.</p>
<p>In those cases, I browse the Popular and Featured themes on Wordpress.org, looking mainly for <strong>active installs</strong>, <strong>rating and number of ratings</strong>, and <strong>when it was last updated</strong>.</p>

<p>Creating a child theme opens up a great deal of customization, without being overwhelming. You can customize your child theme as much or as little as you want.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, I'm going to be using Twenty Seventeen (to begin the theme I will be using for this site!).</p>
<h2>The Stylesheet</h2>
<p>The first step when creating a child theme, and really the <em>only required step</em> is the header in the style.css file.</p>
<p>I use CSS preprocessors (typically I use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, but my current favorite is <a href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a>). I use them to keep my stylesheets separate and modular, then compile them into one.</p>
<p>This is the structure I follow for my Sass, SCSS, or Stylus files, more or less:</p>
<pre>
stylus/
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ reset.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ typography.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ colors.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ header.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ body.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ footer.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ media-queries/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 200.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 480.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 768.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 992.styl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 1200.styl
</pre>
<p>As stated above, I develop child themes locally before uploading them to a live site.</p>
<p>So, create a folder in your themes directory, i.e. <strong>/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/themes</strong>, named <strong>twentyseventeen-child</strong>, or as appropriate if you're using a different parent theme.</p>
<p>Create your style.css file and add the following code.he Basics</p>
<p>This header <strong>must</strong> be at the top of your style.css file (or style.styl), to be a valid Child Theme.<br />
[css]<br />
/*<br />
Theme Name: Twenty Seventeen Child<br />
Theme URI:<br />

Author URI: http://kimberly.codes<br />
Template: twentyseventeen<br />
Description:<br />
Version:<br />

*/<br />
@import url("../twentyseventeen/style.css");<br />
[/css]<br />
Once you have saved the stylesheet, you should be able to see your child theme listed on the Themes Page.</p>
<p><img src="images/themes-list.jpg" alt="child themes wordpress" width="920" height="492" /></p>
<p>To show an image instead of the blank transparency, you can either copy the <strong>screenshot.png</strong> from your parent theme, or create a new <strong>screenshot.png</strong>.</p>
<p>You can take a screenshot and simply add "CHILD THEME" across the picture, or take a screenshot once you have done some customization.</p>
<p>If you use an image different from the parent theme, it makes it a little easier to distinguish which is which on your Themes page.</p>
<p>The recommended dimensions for <strong>screenshot.png</strong> are <strong>1200 x 900</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>You should now be able to activate the theme and begin making your modifications!</p>
<p>In a later post, I'll show you had to make some serious changes to the themes, but for now, you can experiment with new CSS styles.</p>
<hr />
<p>As always, if you encounter any errors during the process, remember to <a href="http://google.com"><em>Google that shit!</em></a></p>
<p>Errors are inevitable when learning new skills.</p>
<p>The best way to learn new skills is to keep going, and keep digging, when you run into these problems.</p>
<p>Though it can be frustrating at times, in the end you will have learned something new! (Yay!)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
