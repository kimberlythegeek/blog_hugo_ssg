                <p>Writing a pytest fixture was actually much easier to do than I expected.</p>
<p>I did find, however, that the documentation on custom pytest fixtures was not very applicable to my situation.</p>
<p>I instead spent quite a lot of time looking at other pytest fixtures, such as <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-html" target="_blank">pytest-html</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium" target="_blank">pytest-selenium</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-base-url" target="_blank">pytest-base-url</a>, trying to figure out how they worked.</p>
<p>Having never used pytest fixtures&mdash;and being new to pytest&mdash;it was a bit of a struggle for me to really understand what was going on.</p>
<p>The most applicable examples that I looked at were pytest-selenium and pytest-base-url.</p>
<h3>pytest-selenium and pytest-base-url</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the pytest-selenium package is that it takes care of the setup and tear down processes for you.</p>
<p>The <code>selenium</code> fixture essentially instantiates and return a <code>webdriver</code> instance.</p>
<p>The fixture also closes the instance for you at the conclusion of your test function.</p>
<p>If <code>base_url</code> is defined in a config file or passed in as a command line argument, pytest-selenium will use this value and load the page automatically at the execution of your test function.</p>
<p>Using pytest-selenium can simplify something like this:</p>
<p>[python]<br />
from selenium import webdriver</p>
<p>def test_python_page_title():<br />
    driver = webdriver.Firefox()<br />
    driver.get("http://www.python.org")<br />
    assert "Python" in driver.title<br />
    driver.close()<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>to this:<br />
[python]<br />
def test_python_page(selenium):<br />
    assert "Python" in selenium.title<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>While <code>pytest-selenium</code> has many more capabilities, and is a complex package, this seems to be the primary purpose, at least as I understand it.</p>
<h3>pytest-axe</h3>
<p><code>pytest-axe</code> is a pytest fixture similar to pytest-selenium, albeit it is extremely simple in comparison.</p>
<p>This package takes a selenium instance and instantiates an instance of the Axe class for you.</p>
<p>It also finds the <code>axe.min.js</code> script in the <code>axe-selenium-python</code> package, and Axe sets it as a class-level variable in its constructor.</p>
<p>I decided to create this fixture to make it easier for users to integrate my axe-selenium-python API into their test suites.</p>
<p>The easier it is to use, the more likely people are to use it.</p>
<p>To illustrate just how basic this package is, this code is the entire functionality of the plugin:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/pytest-axe/blob/master/pytest_axe/pytest_axe.py" target="_blank">pytest_axe.py</a><br />
[python]<br />
import pytest<br />
from axe_selenium_python import Axe</p>
<p>@pytest.fixture<br />
def axe(selenium, base_url):<br />
    """Return an Axe instance based on context and options."""<br />
    selenium.get(base_url)<br />
yield Axe(selenium)<br />
[/python]</p>
<p>I originally implemented this fixture by adding it to <code>conftest.py</code> within the test files in my <code>axe-selenium-python</code> package.</p>
<p>Again, I was surprised at how easy it was to get this to work. It did take some fiddling around, but altogether, very little time was spent on this.</p>
<p>I moved this fixture into a package by itself, because I don't want users to have to manually add the fixture into their <code>conftest.py</code> file.</p>
<p>At best, this would be quite annoying. More than likely, people just wouldn't use it.</p>
