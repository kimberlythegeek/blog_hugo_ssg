          <p>
            A free and open internet.
"The internet is an integral part of modern life, a global public resource, which must enrich the lives of individual human beings."[1] 
 The internet is a vast resource of information, the likes of which have never existed before.
The technologies we possess today have become an indispensable resource, and they improve the quality of our lives in many ways.
But for some, technology is the only thing that stands between them and of a life of dependence and isolation.

            This isn&rsquo;t tech-related. Just some words I&rsquo;ve been trying to find for years. /kimberlythegeek  "Life's not fair, and it doesn't make sense." So many times I’ve wanted to scream that it isn’t fair.
I can’t even begin to make the sounds.
As soon as they manifest in my mind, I hear my dad’s voice echoing those words back to me.
“There are only two rules of life,” he would say.

          <h2>Air Mozilla Presentation - Automating Web Accessibility Testing</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>November 30, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            To conclude my internship with Mozilla, I did a video presentation on Air Mozilla. This is a high-level overview  of the solution I designed to automate accessibility testing.
Below are the slides, followed by the transcript and video.

Automating Web Accessibility Testing Hi, my name is Kimberly Sereduck. I recently completed an internship with Mozilla through the GNOME Outreachy program. As part of the test engineering team, the goal of my internship was to automate web accessibility testing.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Conclusion and Retrospective</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>September 4, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            A Conclusion to My Internship When I began this internship three months ago, neither myself nor my mentor had a clear picture of what I would produce, or how the goals of the project would change as time progressed.
The high-level goal of the internship was clear: to automate web accessibility testing. How best to do this, however, was not.
The first few weeks, as well as the weeks prior, were mostly spent on research.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Writing a pytest Fixture</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>August 21, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Writing a pytest fixture was actually much easier to do than I expected.
I did find, however, that the documentation on custom pytest fixtures was not very applicable to my situation.
I instead spent quite a lot of time looking at other pytest fixtures, such as pytest-html, pytest-selenium, and pytest-base-url, trying to figure out how they worked.
Having never used pytest fixtures&mdash;and being new to pytest&mdash;it was a bit of a struggle for me to really understand what was going on.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Writing a pip Installable Package</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>August 13, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Designing for the User The first part of this project was to create a rough draft of the package, and a set of both unit tests and integration tests.
For the first several weeks, I only used the package locally from the project folder, which turned out to be much easier than writing a working, pip-installable package.
So that was the next goal to accomplish&mdash;but I also wanted to ensure to follow best practices and maintain stability.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Translate Java to Python, Pt. 2</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>July 25, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Continued from Part 1
While I began writing my package as a direct, one-to-one translation of the Java package, my package turned out to look very different.
Java and Python are, after all, very different languages. I found some methods to be unnecessary in python, and chose to not use the same design pattern as axe-selenium-java.
The Java package, written by Deque Labs, uses the Builder design pattern.
I wrote the methods used by the Builder class to be methods of the Axe class instead.

          <p>
            Translating a Java package into Python This is a pretty interesting task for me, to translate Java to Python, and is currently my focus in the internship. What I have found so far is that most of the methods will be much easier to implement in Python than in Java.
I'm glad I'm interpreting Java into Python...and not the reverse!

Take, for example, the get_contents() function:
AXE.java
[java]
private static String getContents(final URL script) {
          </p>

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Diving into Test Automation with Python</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>June 25, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Test Automation with Python The first week of my internship was spent primarily setting up my dev environment on the laptop I received.
I had also never used a Mac before, so there were some basics to learn as well.
Although, since MacOS is Unix-based now, all of the important things were pretty much the same.
(I'm worthless with a Windows command line)
Once I had everything configured, I started fiddling with python and pytest.
