          <h2>Air Mozilla Presentation - Automating Web Accessibility Testing</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>November 30, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            To conclude my internship with Mozilla, I did a video presentation on Air Mozilla. This is a high-level overview  of the solution I designed to automate accessibility testing.
Below are the slides, followed by the transcript and video.

Automating Web Accessibility Testing Hi, my name is Kimberly Sereduck. I recently completed an internship with Mozilla through the GNOME Outreachy program. As part of the test engineering team, the goal of my internship was to automate web accessibility testing.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Conclusion and Retrospective</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>September 4, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            A Conclusion to My Internship When I began this internship three months ago, neither myself nor my mentor had a clear picture of what I would produce, or how the goals of the project would change as time progressed.
The high-level goal of the internship was clear: to automate web accessibility testing. How best to do this, however, was not.
The first few weeks, as well as the weeks prior, were mostly spent on research.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Translate Java to Python, Pt. 1</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>July 11, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Translating a Java package into Python This is a pretty interesting task for me, to translate Java to Python, and is currently my focus in the internship. What I have found so far is that most of the methods will be much easier to implement in Python than in Java.
I'm glad I'm interpreting Java into Python...and not the reverse!

Take, for example, the get_contents() function:
AXE.java
[java]
private static String getContents(final URL script) {
          </p>

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: Diving into Test Automation with Python</h2>
          <p class='text-center'>June 25, 2017</p>
          
          <p>
            Test Automation with Python The first week of my internship was spent primarily setting up my dev environment on the laptop I received.
I had also never used a Mac before, so there were some basics to learn as well.
Although, since MacOS is Unix-based now, all of the important things were pretty much the same.
(I'm worthless with a Windows command line)
Once I had everything configured, I started fiddling with python and pytest.

          <h2>Mozilla Internship: An Introduction to Web Accessibility</h2>

            Introduction to Web Accessibility Outreachy Some background: GNOME's Outreachy internship program is targeted at underrepresented groups in tech.
A variety of open-source companies are involved.
An employee of those companies can volunteer to be a mentor, and they design an internship with a particular topic and goal.
Those who are both interested and eligible submit applications for that internship.
The goal of the internship I was selected for is to automate regression testing for web accessibility.
