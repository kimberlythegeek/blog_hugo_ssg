      <description>To conclude my internship with Mozilla, I did a video presentation on Air Mozilla. This is a high-level overview  of the solution I designed to automate accessibility testing.
Below are the slides, followed by the transcript and video.

Automating Web Accessibility Testing Hi, my name is Kimberly Sereduck. I recently completed an internship with Mozilla through the GNOME Outreachy program. As part of the test engineering team, the goal of my internship was to automate web accessibility testing.</description>

      <description>A Conclusion to My Internship When I began this internship three months ago, neither myself nor my mentor had a clear picture of what I would produce, or how the goals of the project would change as time progressed.
The high-level goal of the internship was clear: to automate web accessibility testing. How best to do this, however, was not.
The first few weeks, as well as the weeks prior, were mostly spent on research.</description>

      <description>Translating a Java package into Python This is a pretty interesting task for me, to translate Java to Python, and is currently my focus in the internship. What I have found so far is that most of the methods will be much easier to implement in Python than in Java.
I&#39;m glad I&#39;m interpreting Java into Python...and not the reverse!

Take, for example, the get_contents() function:
AXE.java
[java]
private static String getContents(final URL script) {</description>

      <title>Mozilla Internship: Diving into Test Automation with Python</title>

      <description>Test Automation with Python The first week of my internship was spent primarily setting up my dev environment on the laptop I received.
I had also never used a Mac before, so there were some basics to learn as well.
Although, since MacOS is Unix-based now, all of the important things were pretty much the same.
(I&#39;m worthless with a Windows command line)
Once I had everything configured, I started fiddling with python and pytest.</description>

      <title>Mozilla Internship: An Introduction to Web Accessibility</title>

      <description>Introduction to Web Accessibility Outreachy Some background: GNOME&#39;s Outreachy internship program is targeted at underrepresented groups in tech.
A variety of open-source companies are involved.
An employee of those companies can volunteer to be a mentor, and they design an internship with a particular topic and goal.
Those who are both interested and eligible submit applications for that internship.
The goal of the internship I was selected for is to automate regression testing for web accessibility.</description>
