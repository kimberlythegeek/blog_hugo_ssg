      <description>Continued from Part 1
While I began writing my package as a direct, one-to-one translation of the Java package, my package turned out to look very different.
Java and Python are, after all, very different languages. I found some methods to be unnecessary in python, and chose to not use the same design pattern as axe-selenium-java.
The Java package, written by Deque Labs, uses the Builder design pattern.
I wrote the methods used by the Builder class to be methods of the Axe class instead.</description>
