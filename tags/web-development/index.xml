      <description>1. Register Custom Sidebar in functions.php
2. Create Custom Sidebar File
3. Call Custom Sidebar!
4. Style as Desired

The nice thing about child themes is that it gives you a full theme as a base, while also allowing for endless customization.
Any file that you write in your child theme, e.g. functions.php, header.php, sidebar.php, will overwrite the parent theme&#39;s file.
It&#39;s worth mentioning that this doesn&#39;t seem to be working on my local WordPress install, with theme Twenty Seventeen.</description>

      <title>Child Themes in Wordpress - Getting Started</title>

      <description>The Basics of Child Themes There are many reasons why you should create child themes when using any customization. If you modify the CSS or PHP directly in a Wordpress theme, and later update the theme, all of your changes will be lost.
With child themes, you can update the parent themes without overwriting your custom styles.

I prefer to use a theme released directly from Wordpress.org, such as Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, etc.</description>
