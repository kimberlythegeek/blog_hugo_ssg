      <description>Writing a pytest fixture was actually much easier to do than I expected.
I did find, however, that the documentation on custom pytest fixtures was not very applicable to my situation.
I instead spent quite a lot of time looking at other pytest fixtures, such as pytest-html, pytest-selenium, and pytest-base-url, trying to figure out how they worked.
Having never used pytest fixtures&amp;mdash;and being new to pytest&amp;mdash;it was a bit of a struggle for me to really understand what was going on.</description>

      <description>Designing for the User The first part of this project was to create a rough draft of the package, and a set of both unit tests and integration tests.
For the first several weeks, I only used the package locally from the project folder, which turned out to be much easier than writing a working, pip-installable package.
So that was the next goal to accomplish&amp;mdash;but I also wanted to ensure to follow best practices and maintain stability.</description>
