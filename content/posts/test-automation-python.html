<h1>Test Automation with Python</h1>
<p>The first week of my internship was spent primarily setting up my dev environment on the laptop I received.</p>
<p>I had also never used a Mac before, so there were some basics to learn as well.</p>
<p>Although, since MacOS is Unix-based now, all of the important things were pretty much the same.</p>
<p>(I'm worthless with a Windows command line)</p>
<p>Once I had everything configured, I started fiddling with python and pytest.</p>
<p>I've done some development in python, like a scrabble-esque game, but I'd never written tests in python before.</p>
<h2>axe-core</h2>
<p>In order to automate regression testing for accessibility, we need an API of some sort.</p>
<p>I did some research on the available web accessibility APIs before settling on the <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">axe-core API</a>.</p>
<p>The axe-core API was created by <a href="https://www.deque.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deque</a>, a company that specializes in accessibility.</p>
<p>Deque offers assessment services, <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certifications</a>, and more.</p>
<p>axe-core is written in JavaScript and distributed as an an npm package.</p>
<p>Eventually, I will create a more seamless integration of axe-core into python, by writing a python library.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dequelabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DequeLabs</a> did this with Java in their tool <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-selenium-java" target="_blank" rel="noopener">axe-selenium-java</a>.</p>
<p>To get started, though, I will be using Selenium's <code>execute_script()</code> function to handle the JavaScript directly.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Testing with aXe</h2>
<p>The aXe API tests a website against a configurable set of <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md" target="_blank">rules</a>.</p>
<p>These rules are based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/"F>WCAG 2.0</a>, <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/section-508-standards#subpart_b" target="_blank">Section 508</a>, and best practices endorsed by Deque.</p>
<p>The test loads an instance of Firefox, injects the axe-core script, and then injects a custom script that runs the API.</p>
<p>I didn't have a way to directly pass data from the JavaScript back to python (this will be addressed by the axe_selenium_python package I'm writing).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this test, I used JavaScript to write the JSON results to an element in the DOM.</p>
<p>I then grabbed the contents of that element using Selenium in my python test.</p>
<p>For my first iteration of the test, I simply asserted that there were no <code>violations</code> with an <code>impact</code> of <code>critical</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/axe-tests/blob/ac40996034a8e0165635379cbf5d4ebaaf7060f1/tests/test_critical_violations.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test_critical_violations.py</a><br />
[python]<br />
class TestCriticalViolations:</p>
<p>    @pytest.mark.nondestructive<br />
    def test_accessibility_critical_violations(self):<br />
        # List to hold info about critical violations<br />
        criticalViolations = []<br />
        data = json.load(open('./result.json'))<br />
        # Iterate through violations<br />
        for item in data['violations']:<br />
            # Find all critical violations<br />
            if item['impact'] == 'critical':<br />
                # Add description to list<br />
                criticalViolations.append(item['help'])</p>
<p>        # Assert that no critical violations are found<br />
        assert len(criticalViolations) == 0, 'Critical Failures found'<br />
[/python]</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kimberlythegeek/axe-tests/blob/ac40996034a8e0165635379cbf5d4ebaaf7060f1/src/script.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script.js</a><br />
[js]<br />
// Get axe-core rules<br />
// Default setting is all rules<br />
axe.getRules();<br />
// Run axe<br />
axe.run()<br />
// On success, process results<br />
.then(function(result){<br />
  console.log(result);<br />
  // Get element<br />
  var window = document.getElementsByTagName('html');<br />
  // Create new div element<br />
  var node = document.createElement('DIV');<br />
  // Populate div with results text<br />
  var textNode = document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(result));<br />
  node.appendChild(textNode);<br />
  // Add selector to element<br />
  node.setAttribute('id', 'axe-result');<br />
  // And append to element<br />
  window[0].appendChild(node);<br />
});<br />
[/js]</p>
<p>This first version of my test used the python packages pytest and selenium.</p>
<p>I modified the test to use the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-selenium/1.10.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pytest-selenium</a> package, written by <a href="https://github.com/davehunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Hunt</a> of the Firefox Test Engineering team.</p>
<p>This package adds some additional functionality, and makes testing with selenium a little easier.</p>
<p>I added another package, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-html" target="_blank">pytest-html</a> (also written by Dave Hunt), to generate an HTML report of the pytest results.</p>
<p>I also implemented the tests with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tox</a>, so that I could run the tests in both Python 2.7 and Python 3 simultaneously.</p>
<p>I then wrote a test for each rule used by axe-core, to get more meaningful output from the test suite.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing that critical violations were found, I am now able to see each test that passed and each test that failed.</p>

<p>Now that I understand how to use pytest and Selenium, the next step will be learning how to write Python packages.</p>
