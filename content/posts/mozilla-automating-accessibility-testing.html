<h3>Automating Web Accessibility Testing</h3>
<blockquote><p>Hi, my name is Kimberly Sereduck. I recently completed an internship with Mozilla through the GNOME Outreachy program. As part of the test engineering team, the goal of my internship was to automate web accessibility testing.</p>
<p>Which, for most people, probably brings up two new questions in itself:<br />
What is Automated Testing?<br />
What is Web Accessibility?</p>
<h4>What is automated testing?</h4>
<p>In order to ensure the quality of software and websites, software engineers and test engineers write tests to check that the product works as it should. Automated tests often run on a set schedule, or when an update is released.</p>
<h4>What is Web Accessibility?</h4>
<p>Accessibility is a word we have probably all heard before, but you may or may not understand what it means. Even while working as a web developer, I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly what it was, or why it was important.<br />
<br><br />
Imagine for a moment that, when browsing the web, your knowledge of what a page contains was based exclusively on dialogue from a Screen Reader.<br />
<br><br />
A screen reader is a type of software that will read aloud the contents of a page, including headers, links, alternative text for images, input elements, and more.<br />
<br><br />
This technology allows users with limited vision to navigate the resources of the internet.<br />
<br><br />
However, if a website is not designed with accessibility in mind, it can still be very difficult or even impossible for these types of users to understand what a page contains, or to interact with it.<br />
<br><br />
This is just one example of a user who requires an accessible web. There are many different types of users, who utilize different types of assistive technologies.<br />
<br><br />
This brings me to the topic of web accessibility testing.<br />
<br><br />
Web accessibility testing is simply an analysis of how accessible a website is.<br />
<br><br />
There are detailed standards of web accessibility called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG for short.<br />
<br><br />
An example of one of these rules is that all images must contain alternative text. This text would be read aloud by a screen reader.<br />
<br><br />
If an image is used to help convey a point, providing an alt attribute allows non-sighted users to understand the context more fully.<br />
<br><br />
In the example here, a graph is an image used to convey information, and not used just for display purposes.<br />
<br><br />
A good alternative text would be to concisely describe what information the graph contains.<br />
<br></p>
<h4>Problem Domain</h4>
<p>Accessibility testing for websites, is, at this point, largely manual work. There are many tools that exist to generate accessibility reports for websites. These are mostly limited to browser-based tools.<br />
<br><br />
Here is an example of one of the browser-based tools.<br />
<br><br />
Most of these tools do not offer much in the way of customization or flexibility.<br />
<br><br />
Most of them return a list or report of all accessibility violations found on a single page.<br />
<br><br />
However, almost all websites are comprised of multiple pages, and some may even have dozens of different types of pages.<br />
<br><br />
Using one of these browser-based accessibility tests would require someone manually running the tests on each different type of page, reviewing the results, and creating an accessibility report for the site.<br />
<br><br />
For most companies that address the accessibility of their websites, this is done on an irregular basis, and is not integrated into their automated testing workflow.<br />
<br><br />
An example of what I mean by automated testing workflow:<br />
<br><br />
If an update is made to the website download.mozilla.org, which results in users not being able to download Firefox, there are automated tests in place to catch these errors.<br />
<br><br />
This enables test engineers to be notified right away, rather than the problem going unnoticed until someone happens to catch it.<br />
<br><br />
This type of testing is called regression testing. Regression tests make sure that features that worked before an update still work after the update.<br />
<br></p>
<h4>What Problem Does This Solve?</h4>
<p>The problem that this project solves is to integrate regression testing for web accessibility into this automated workflow.<br />
<br><br />
So, if a site is accessible, and an update is released that makes it less accessible, these tests would notify test engineers of the new accessibility violations.<br />
<br><br />
To make this possible, I have written software that allows python programmers to make use of a tool called aXe in their python tests.<br />
<br><br />
aXe is a an API created by Deque Systems, a company that specializes in web accessibility.<br />
<br><br />
aXe can be run against a web page and return a list of all violations of accessibility rules.<br />
<br><br />
aXe also allows customization, such as including or excluding certain accessibility rules, or testing specific parts of a page.<br />
<br><br />
The software I have written, called axe-selenium-python, maintains this ability to customize your accessibility tests.<br />
<br><br />
The way this software works is that it is included in existing automated tests, adding accessibility checks for each page that the tests visit.<br />
<br><br />
This puts accessibility on the same level as functionality, and accessibility reports will be generated every time a test suite is run, rather than manually and infrequently.<br />
<br><br />
Creating a more inclusive web is a top priority to the people at Mozilla.<br />
<br><br />
Mozilla has a dedicated accessibility team that does check their websites for accessibility.<br />
<br><br />
However, we would like to give the test engineering team the ability to include accessibility checks in their automated testing workflow.<br />
<br><br />
My work will enable Mozilla to test the accessibility of its websites on a more regular basis, and do it using much less time and resources.<br />
<br></p>
<h4>Goals for the Future</h4>
<p>Although the software I have written is functional and currently available for public use, there are many goals to improve it, making it more simple to use and more beneficial.</p>
<h5>Package</h5>
<p>There are three main goals for improving the package I have written. The first is to devise a production-ready solution for testing individual accessibility rules, rather than running a single accessibility check for each page.<br />
<br><br />
The reason for this is two-fold.<br />
<br><br />
Without individual tests, there is a single PASS or FAIL for accessibility. If ANY rule is violated, this test fails. This also means that the results of the failing rules are shown in a single report.<br />
<br><br />
However, if individual tests exist, there will be a pass or fail for each accessibility rule that is tested for, making the results more readable.<br />
<br><br />
Test engineers would be able to quickly see the number of violations, and which rules were violated.<br />
<br><br />
Having individual tests also allows the ability to mark tests as expected failures.<br />
<br><br />
In the world of test engineering, when a failure is spotted, typically a bug or issue is filed, and the test will continue to fail until the bug is fixed. It is not uncommon for some issues to go unaddressed for weeks.<br />
<br><br />
In most cases, you don&rsquo;t want to keep getting notifications of a failing test after a bug has been filed.<br />
<br><br />
So the tests are marked as expected failures, and instead of being notified when they fail, the test engineers will be notified when the test begins passing again.<br />
<br><br />
I want to enable this same functionality with my software.<br />
<br><br />
While I have succeeded with a couple of different approaches, neither of them can be easily integrated into existing test suites.<br />
<br><br />
I want my solution to be as hassle-free as possible, allowing users to easily add and customize these individual tests.<br />
<br><br />
The third goal for improving this package is to generate more sophisticated accessibility reports. I want to allow users to view a single report for accessibility, one that is well designed and presents the information in a way that is easier to understand.<br />
<br></p>
<h5>Company</h5>
<p>A long-term goal that I have as far as the company is concerned is to develop an Accessibility dashboard for all of Mozilla&rsquo;s web assets.<br />
<br><br />
This dashboard would use the data from the most recent accessibility tests, and give each Mozilla website a grade or rating for accessibility.<br />
<br><br />
This dashboard would be included with others that are currently displayed in several of the Mozilla offices around the world.<br />
<br><br />
Producing this dashboard would increase the visibility and awareness of Mozilla&rsquo;s accessibility status, which, in turn, would have a significant impact on Mozilla&rsquo;s goal of creating a more inclusive web.<br />
<br></p>
<h5>Community</h5>
<p>Another goal I have for this project is to involve community contributors in Mozilla&rsquo;s accessibility goals.<br />
<br><br />
One idea for increasing community involvement is by adding a new feature to my axe-selenium-python package, or to write a new package altogether.<br />
<br><br />
This feature or package would automatically file a bug when a new accessibility violation is found.<br />
<br><br />
Most accessibility violations are fairly easy to fix, and require only a basic knowledge of HTML.<br />
<br><br />
As such, they would make great First Bugs for people who have never contributed to Mozilla or an open-source project before.<br />
<br><br />
This would help increase community contributions overall, and also to expedite the process of fixing these accessibility violations.<br />
<br><br />
This feature could tremendously affect Mozilla&rsquo;s inclusivity goals, and do so without adding a large workload to full-time employees.<br />
<br></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>More and more people every day have access to the internet.<br />
<br><br />
Millions of these users have limited vision or limited physical ability, and rely on technologies other than a mouse and a screen to navigate the web.<br />
<br><br />
The internet is a vast resource that opens up a world of knowledge that humans have never had access to before. It is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of life.<br />
<br><br />
Knowledge, to me, is not a privilege, but a basic human right. As such, I believe that the resources of the internet should be made accessible to all types of users.<br />
<br><br />
An accessible web also allows all people to participate more actively in society.<br />
<br><br />
I am very fortunate to have had an opportunity to help create a more inclusive web. I hope to continue to do so, and make an even more significant impact in the world of accessibility and inclusivity.</p>
